# VHDL_Calculator

Implemented a calculator based off an ISA design with 5 instructions. This project includes behavioral hardware components for:
    -- ALU
    -- Control singals
    -- Instruction fetch
    -- Print module
    -- Single 8-bit register
    -- Register file for four registers

Included are testbench files which demonstrates each compontents' abilty to carry out it's specific function. The structural architecture is found in the final calculator.vhdl file. There is also a testbench file that shows the hardwares components' ability to function together. More details on how the calculator operates is found in the report.
